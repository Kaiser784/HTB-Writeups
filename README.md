# HTB-writeups
This repo contains writeups for HackTheBox challenges, machines and Pro labs and is managed with Obsidian for ease of report writing and searching back for when needed.

All the tags are for organizing in Obsidian and do not have much relevance otherwise.

The images aren't being properly formatted in Github markdown so you won't be able to see them if you're on github. If you really want to see the full images I suggest you to clone the repo and open them in Obsidian.
